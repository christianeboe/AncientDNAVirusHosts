## Data availability
All data required to reproduce the analyses and plots in plots_viruses.R are provided in this repository except for Supplementary Tables 1 and 3, which are required as additional input files. These supplementary tables should be placed in the data/ folder before running the relevant scripts. The datasets can be reproduced from the raw data and the code by Liu et al. (2026; preprint) (https://github.com/sisiliu-research/EnviHoli).

All data required to run ancient_pattern_analysis.R can be reproduced from the raw data and the code provided by von Hippel et al. (2025) (https://zenodo.org/records/15328439) and Çabuk et al. (2025) (https://zenodo.org/records/14810762).
